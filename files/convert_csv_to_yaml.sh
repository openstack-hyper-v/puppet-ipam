# Usage: ./convert-manifest.sh filename

# This script will take a csv containing hostname, static lease ip address, and MAC Address (in that order)  and convert it to the manifest format 
# MAC Addresses will be converted to aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff format if they do not contain a colon.  Additionally they will be converted to lowercase.  

# The output will be saved with the same base filename with a leases.yaml extension, overwriting the file if it's run more than once.  
# This data is meant to be appended to your YAML file containing system wide variables or called from it.
# The contents of this are meant to be appended in the static_leases section of a yaml file.

# Error checking is limited at this stage but will verify that IPs and MAC addresses appear to be the right format.
